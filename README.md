# üß† Mental Health Diagnosis Prediction (Text-Based)

This project provides a web-based tool for analyzing user-submitted text and predicting possible mental or emotional conditions using machine learning.

## üîç Description

The application allows users to input free-form text (such as messages, posts, or diary entries), which is then analyzed by a natural language processing (NLP) model to predict a potential psychological state. It uses transformer-based architectures (ensemble RoBERTa and DeBERTa) that capture deep contextual and semantic information from the input text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Simple web interface for entering text
- Text preprocessing and vectorization
- State classification using a trained neural network
- Output of predicted diagnosis and associated probability
- Disclaimer message to clarify that predictions are not medical diagnoses

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- HTML + Bootstrap 5
- Transformers (via HuggingFace)
- scikit-learn, pandas
